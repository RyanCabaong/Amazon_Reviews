# Amazon_Reviews
The purpose of this project is to determine any rating bias on paid reviews in comparison to unpaid reviews on video game products from 2006 to 2015.
In summary, the dataset needed a PySpark ETL process to be extracted, connected to an AWS RDS Instance, and loaded as transformed data into pgAdmin for presentation.
However, this project did not come without difficulties as I was unfamiliar with making a AWS Databases. I was lucky to consult a professional and become more experienced.

does paying for positive reviews make a difference here?

34% of unpaid reviews are 5 stars
40% of paid reviews are 5 stars 
doesn't make much of a difference
